This content will explain briefly the Jenkins pipeline syntax used for defining JenkinsFile on my .mdfile on Github.

Pipeline {										                    1
agent any										                      2

tools {											                      3
maven ‘Maven3’
}
stages {
stage (‘Build’) {									                4
steps {														
sh ‘mvn clean install -f MyWebapp/pom.xml’				5
}
}
stage (‘Jacoco’) {									              6
steps {	
jacoco()
}
}
stage (‘Dev Deploy’) {								            7
steps {	
echo “deploying to DEV Env”							          8
deploy adapters: [tomcat9(credentialsId: '7177fb7b-3b26-46b8-ae25-adaf5df8d1a5', path: '', url: 'http://ec2-13-58-177-101.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080')], contextPath: null, war: '**/*.war'	
}                                                 9
}
}
}


1) Pipeline: A declarative pipeline-specific syntax was used and it defines block containing all content and instructions for executing the entire pipeline.
2) Agent: A declarative pipeline-specific syntax that instructs Jenkins to allocate an executor and work space for the entire Pipeline.
3) Maven3: A build tool that I used to build java
4) Stage: MyWebapp which is my project is being built in this stage
5) Steps: I installed Maven with a pom.xml file used to declare all dependencies and plugins
6) Stage: Jacoco plugin was added for integration
7) Stage: Dev will be deployed to its environment
8) Deploying app to Dev Environment . 
9) Apache Tomcat was implemented to provide a pure java web server environment in which Mywebapp can run.
